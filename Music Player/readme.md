# Music Player Project

This JavaScript music player project is a part of my educational learning journey with the guidance provided by FreeCodeCamp. The goal is to construct a functional music player with various features to enhance my programming skills.

## Project Overview

### Features

- **Play/Pause:** Control the playback and pause of the current song.
- **Next/Previous:** Navigate to the next or previous song in the playlist.
- **Shuffle:** Play songs in a random order.
- **Delete Song:** Remove a specific song from the playlist.
- **Reset Playlist:** Reset the playlist to its original state.

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- **index.html:** Main HTML file for the project.
- **styles.css:** CSS file for styling the music player interface.
- **script.js:** JavaScript file containing the logic for the music player.
- **songs.js:** File containing the list of songs for playback.
- **images/:** Folder containing images of the player's control buttons.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The player interface will be displayed, showing song information and control buttons.
3. Use the control buttons to play/pause, navigate between songs, shuffle, delete, and reset the playlist.

Feel free to customize and expand the project based on your learning objectives. Enjoy building and exploring the world of JavaScript through this music player project!
